## Example `simulate_mm_api`

This is a basic example of how to use the simulator with `mm_api`. It shoes how to initialize and destroy the `mm_api` context and how to get the data from the simulator at different moments in time.

To run the example in C call the following command in `sem-simulator` directory:
```shell
./build/simulate_mm_api examples/simulate_mm_api/scenario
```

To run the example in Python first build and source the virtual environment (as explained in repo's global README) and then call the following command in `sem-simulator` directory:
```shell
python3 examples/simulate_mm_api/simulate_mm_api.py
```

The simulation scenario is in the directory `examples/simulate_mm_api/scenario`.
