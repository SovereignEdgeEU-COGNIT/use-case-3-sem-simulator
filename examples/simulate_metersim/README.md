## Example `simulate_metersim`

This is a basic example of how to use the `metersim` library. It shoes how to initialize and destroy the `metersim` context and how to get the data from the simulator at different moments in time.

To run the example in C call the following command in `sem-simulator` directory:
```shell
./build/simulate_metersim examples/simulate_metersim/scenario
```

To run the example in Python first build and source the virtual environment (as explained in repo's global README) and then call the following command in `sem-simulator` directory:
```shell
python3 examples/simulate_metersim/simulate_metersim.py
```

The simulation scenario is in the directory `examples/simulate_metersim/scenario`.
